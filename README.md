## Installation

### MacOS

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your machine you can install by running:

```
You will need to run `brew install ffmpeg` afterwards, if you don't already have one of these packages.

### Debian and Ubuntu

svtplay-dl is available in Debian strech and later and on Ubuntu 16.04 and later, which means you can install it straight away using apt. The version in their repo is often old and thus we **strongly** recommend using our own apt repo, which always include the latest version. The svtplay-dl repo for Debian / Ubuntu can be found at [apt.svtplay-dl.se](https://apt.svtplay-dl.se/).

##### Add the release PGP keys:
```
    curl -s https://svtplay-dl.se/release-key.txt | sudo apt-key add -
```

##### Add the "release" channel to your APT sources:
```
    echo "deb https://apt.svtplay-dl.se/ svtplay-dl release" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/svtplay-dl.list
```
